# Outserv: Blockchain Search

Outserv enables you to run production grade GraphQL Search APIs over any
blockchain data 10x faster than existing mechanisms.

Outserv is the only system which combines the power of a saerch engine, a cache
engine and a GraphQL layer, thus replacing three different systems in
production.

Outserv makes it trivial for anyone to bring up a production grade
GraphQL tech stack -- which we consider to be an important step to web3
decentralization.

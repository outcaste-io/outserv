# Outserv: Blockchain Search with GraphQL APIs

Outserv enables you to run production grade GraphQL Search APIs over any
blockchain data 10x faster than existing mechanisms.

Outserv is the only system which combines the power of a search engine, a cache
engine and a GraphQL layer, thus replacing three different systems in
production.

With a single executable binary, Outserv makes it trivial for anyone to bring up
a production grade GraphQL tech stack -- which I consider to be an important
step towards web3 decentralization.

## Five Reasons Why You Should Choose Outserv over Cloud API Services

1. Having control over your own API server and blockchain node is the holy grail of decentralization -- the big leap that web3 has over web2.
1. Never run into rate limits, ever again.
1. Not only is Outserv high-performant, having a dedicated system running
    closer to edge, just for your usage, would always outperform far-away cloud
    API servers where your queries have to compete for resources against all
    others.
1. Data is no one-size-fits-all. Enrich the blockchain data by adding more
    context, combining data from multiple sources to allow for better searches.
1. For medium to heavy workloads, Outserv would be way cheaper than paying for
    various Cloud API access.
